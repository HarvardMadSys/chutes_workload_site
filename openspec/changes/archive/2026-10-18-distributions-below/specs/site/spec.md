## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Repository layout
The repository SHALL have this layout, and git SHALL track nothing beyond it
and `.gitignore`:

```
README.md         what the site shows, where the numbers come from, how to build the data, serve and deploy
CONTRIBUTING.md   the rules, the patterns to copy, and how to verify a change
CLAUDE.md         a pointer to the two files above and the git rules
Makefile          make setup, setup-browser, tables, data, serve, test, snapshots, deploy
wrangler.jsonc    the Cloudflare Worker that serves site/ as static assets
pyproject.toml    Python 3.12; pyarrow, pandas and duckdb (pinned); pytest and Playwright (pinned) for tests
package.json      sets ES modules for node --test; wrangler, the one dev dependency; package-lock.json pins it
.nvmrc            the Node version the deploy workflow uses
.github/          workflows/deploy.yml: the deploy on every push to main
site_data/        builds tables/ from the released trace, and site/data/ from the artifact repository and tables/
tables/           built by make tables and tracked: the weekly histograms and their sidecar
site/             exactly the files that are deployed
  index.html      the one page
  style.css       tokens, layout and components
  favicon.svg     the brand mark, for the browser tab
  js/shared/      the answers, the libraries, formatting, charts, series, the layout, the link marks, the scrolling row
  js/charts/      the nine chart kinds: donut, stacked_bars, lines, bands, cells, raster, scatter, boxes, bars
  js/axes/        the ticks of the charts' axes
  js/theme/       the site's colours as the style tokens give them
  js/pages/       the page's module
  js/landing/     the hero, the stats strip, the two mixes (by family and by endpoint), the cite and team sections
  js/explore/     the page's start, the legend of buttons, the topic tabs, the list of the Insights' topics
  js/traffic/     the Traffic Explorer: its section, its filter, its controls, its bars, its day range, its tiles, and its distributions and their three charts
  js/insights/    the figure cards and the topics: one module per Insights topic with its takeaway and its groups of cards, and the routing card's panels
  queries/        one .sql file per query answer, under explore/; under setup/ the queries of the derived tables; under trace/ the query of the trace table
  data/           built by make data and tracked: the query answers, the queries' hashes, the figure answers and their index
tests/            Python tests, node --test files, the fake page they share (its elements found by selector), and snapshots/: the six page states as text
openspec/         the specs and the open changes; archived changes live in git history
```

#### Scenario: Generated data is never committed by hand
- **WHEN** a file under `site/data/` differs from what `make data` writes for the artifact's checkout and `tables/`
- **THEN** the repository test SHALL fail naming the file when `ARTIFACT` is set

#### Scenario: A module in the wrong folder
- **WHEN** a module is added outside the folders above
- **THEN** the repository test SHALL fail naming it

### Requirement: The look follows Open Data
The site SHALL use Open Data's tokens: the paper background `#f8f7f5`,
white surfaces, ink `#1c1917`, the rule `#e4dfdb`, the crimson accent
`#a51c30` with its dark and tint; Crimson Text for headings, the stat
numbers and the affiliation, Inter for body text, and the monospace
stack, uppercase and letter-spaced, for eyebrows, chips, the nav and the
cite caption. Cards SHALL carry a 1px rule, a soft shadow and a 0.9rem
radius. A dark scheme SHALL follow the visitor's system preference, with
the paper, surfaces and inks retuned dark. The ten series slots SHALL
be the same hues in both schemes, at least 30° apart in OKLCH, each at
least 3:1 in contrast against its scheme's card, and a test SHALL check
every colour token's contrast in both schemes. Every section SHALL be
laid out at the page's content width, centred, except the Traffic
Explorer's, which SHALL span the window less the gutters. The gutters
SHALL be the page's padding, and the page's content width, its width
less the gutters, a cap on each section that the Traffic Explorer's
alone does not take; the header and the footer SHALL cap themselves at
the page's width, gutters included, so a section's edges meet their
content's.

#### Scenario: A heading
- **WHEN** any heading renders
- **THEN** its computed font family SHALL begin with Crimson Text

#### Scenario: Dark system scheme
- **WHEN** the visitor's system prefers a dark scheme
- **THEN** the page SHALL render on the dark paper, every series at least 3:1 against its card

#### Scenario: A section's width
- **WHEN** the window is wider than the page's width
- **THEN** every section except the Traffic Explorer's SHALL be centred at the page's content width, its edges under the header's content's, and the explorer's SHALL reach the gutters at both sides, with no horizontal scroll
